hdfs namenode --format --> format the namenode metadata. Lose all the metadat inofrmation. 

    Hadoop namenode directory contains the fsimage and edit files which holds the basic information's about hadoop file system such as where is data available, which user created files like that

    If you format the namenode then the above information's are deleted from namenode directory which is specified in the hdfs-site.xml as dfs.namenode.name.dir

    But you still have the datas on the hadoop but not namenode meta data
